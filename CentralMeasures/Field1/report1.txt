Assignment-1 :- Car data with 50 observations.

TOOL USED :- R programming language.

ASSUMPTIONS :- 
	a) Each row in the data represents the distance covered by the car at the given speed.
	b) In every row we can calculate the time for which the car travelled at the given speed.
	c) After calculating the time duration for each row, we can calculate average speed of the car by dividing sum of all 
	   distances by sum of all time durations.

METHODOLOGY :- 
	a) Arithmetic mean of n numbers is :-
					AM = (a1 + a2 ....... + an)/n
				
	b) Geometric mean of n numbers is :-
					GM = (a1*a2.......*an)^(1/n)
				
	c) Harmonic mean of n numbers is :- 
					HM = n/((1/a1) + (1/a2) ........ + (1/an))
				
RESULTS :-
	It was found that arithmetic mean of speeds was closest in value to the average speed. On basis of closeness with 
	average speed following order was observed :-
					AM(closest) > GM > HM
				
	Arithmetic mean calculation has real significance to the data in this case because the data is varying i.e. data has 
	varying distances and varying speeds. In such scenarios Geometric mean or Harmonic mean may give a very loose 
	approximation of average speed whereas Arithmetic mean gives a value very close to average speed. 

OTHER MEASUREMENTS :- 
	Summing up all the distances and diving this sum by sum of all time durations gives accurate measure of average speed 
	of the car.
