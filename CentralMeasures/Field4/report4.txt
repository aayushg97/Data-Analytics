Assignment-4 :- Irish data with 50 observations

TOOL USED :- R programming language.

MEHODOLOGY :- 
	a) Take sum of all data values, divide this sum by 150 and store it as population mean.
	b) Take the sum of squares of difference of each data-value and mean, divide this sum by 150 and store it as 
	   population variance.
	b) Select 50 random numbers in the range [1-150] and select the rows with one of these random numbers as index thus 
	   forming a random sample of size 50.
	c) Calculate sample mean and variance in the same way as population mean and variance were calculated.
	
RESULTS :-
	Sample parameters (mean and variance) are approximately equal to population parameters (mean and variance).
