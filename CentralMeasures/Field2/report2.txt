Assignment-2 :- Earthquake data with 8083 observations

TOOL USED :- R programming language

METHODOLOGY :- 
	"Five point summary" of a data is a collection of five points namely :-
	a) Minimum
	b) 1st Quartile (25%)
	c) Median		(50%)
	d) 3rd Quartile (75%)
	e) Maximum
	
	Computing "Five point summary"
	-> 1st Quartile is determined by computing the median of data between minimum value and median of whole data.
	-> 3rd Quartile is determined by computing the median of data between median of whole data and maximum value.
	-> Median is the middle value in sorted data.
	-> First value of sorted data is the minimum value of data.
	-> Last value of sorted data is the maximum value of data.
	
	To remove outliers from the dataset IQR(Inter-Quartile range) method was used which is as follows :-
	a) Let first quartile of dataset be Q1, third quartile of dataset be Q3 and median of dataset be Q2.
	b) Calculate IQR (inter-quartile range).  IQR <- Q3 - Q1.
	c) Define L as the lower limit and U as upper limit to determine the outliers.
	d) L <- Q1 - (1.5*IQR)  and  U <- Q3 + (1.5*IQR).
	e) Remove all the data points that lie outside the [L,U] interval.
	f) Resulting dataset is free of any outliers.
	
RESULTS :- 
	Boxplot obtained from original data shows many outliers as circles. These outliers severely affect the analysis of 
	data. Also the in the boxplot of original data, boxes are scattered resulting in high variance whereas in the boxplot 
	of outlier-free data, boxes are more or less similar to each other thereby lowering the variance by a considerable 
	amount. Analysis using the boxplot of outlier-free data will provide accurate results and information.
