Assignment-3 :- Automobile data with 205 observations.

TOOL USED :- R programming language.

METHODOLOGY :- 
	Attributes can be categorized into four main categories :- 
	a) Nominal :- These are the attributes which can be divided into two or more groups such that there is no ordering 
				  among the groups. 
	b) Ordinal :- These are the attributes which can be divided into two or more groups such that there is some ordering 
				  among the groups.
	c) Interval :- These are the attributes that support addition and subtraction operations and have some ordering 
				   property.
	d) Ratio :- These are the attributes that support addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations and 
				have some ordering property.
				
RESULTS :-
	The attribute "city-mpg" is likely to follow NORMAL distribution and the attribute "peak-rpm" is likely to follow 
	BIMODAL distribution.
